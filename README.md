# Anagram

## Description

Write a program to generate all potential anagrams of an input string. 

For example, the potential anagrams of "biro" are 

biro bior brio broi boir bori 
ibro ibor irbo irob iobr iorb 
rbio rboi ribo riob roib robi 
obir obri oibr oirb orbi orib


Write the following function:

        anagram(string s)

## The Challenge

The challenge is to implement this function using a strict TDD approach. Begin with the degenerate case (the empty string , "") and build up the solution from there.

### Test Cases

        assert.equal(anagram(""),"" )
